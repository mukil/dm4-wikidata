# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Search

This plugin  provides users the functionality they need to build personal views, so called _Topic Maps_, based on wikidata.

In particular this plugin provides users the following options and commands:

*   `Wikidata Search`-Mode in the `Toolbar`, with the options
    *    to search for `Items` by text (wikidata query string)
    *    to search for `Properties` by text (wikidata query string) and
    *    to specifiy the `Language` of the wikidata-community for each search
*   `Import Claims`-command available on any `Search Result`-Topic (of type _item_)
*   `Create Association Type`-command available on any `Search Result`-Topic (of type _property_)

The motivation for this plugin was to enable users and researchers from various language-communities to (a) _query_ and _navigate_ the actual wikidata in a graphical way and (b) based on that, _create_ and _share_ personal views (so called Topic Maps) around items currently discussed in wikidata.

Currently wikidata can be queried in 44 languages. If your language is missing here, please excuse that and file an issue at http://trac.deepamehta.de.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

## Download & Installation

You can find a bundle file for installation at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).

Copy the downloaded `dm44-wikidata-search-0.0.x.jar` file into your DeepaMehta bundle repository and re-start your [DeepaMehta installation](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#requirements).

## Usage

Instead of "By Text" choose the "Wikidata Search"-Search Mode in the DeepaMehta Toolbar. Select the language you want to search and enter the term you are interested in.

For any search-result entity of type "item" you can `Import claims` and after that, navigate to ''related'' wikidata-items.

For any search-result entity of type "property" ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [they are](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) there is a "+" (`Turn into Associaton Type`-command) availble in the result listing.
