# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Search Module

This DeepaMehta 4 module enables you to search, explore and map wikidata items (the "shared structures of meaning" - Janet Murray, New Media Reader, 2003 - of [wikidata-communities](http://www.wikidata.org/wiki) from all around the globe) based on their relations.

In particular this plugin enables you to build on wikidata in your personal information work through:

* enabling you to turn any search-result entity of type "property" ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [see list of examples here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) into a DeepaMehta *Assocation Type*
* enabling you to "Import claims" of any "Wikidata Item" (roughly anything that has at least one wikipedia-page?) and thus navigate along related wikidata items

[DeepaMehta 4](http://www.deepamehta.de) is a free software platform for associative and personal information work and a situation-centered user interface based on *free placement* in *stable views*.

## Usage

Instead of "By Text" choose the "Wikidata Search"-Search Mode in the DeepaMehta Toolbar. Select the language you want to search and enter the term you are interested in.

Any search-result entity of type "property" ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [they are](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) can be turned into an ''Association Type'' if you click the "+" command (visible in the result listing).

For any search-result entity of type "item" you can `Import claims` and after that, navigate to ''related'' items.
