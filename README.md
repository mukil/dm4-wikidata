# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Search

This plugin  provides users the functionality they need to build personal views, so called _Topic Maps_, based on wikidata.

In particular this plugin provides users the following options and commands:

*   `Wikidata Search`-Mode in the `Toolbar`, with the options
    *    to search for `Items` by text (wikidata query string)
    *    to search for `Properties` by text (wikidata query string) and
    *    to specifiy the `Language` of the wikidata-community for each search
*   `Import Claims`-command available on any `Search Result`-Topic (of type _item_)
*   `Create Association Type`-command available on any `Search Result`-Topic (of type _property_)

The motivation for this plugin was to enable users and researchers from various language-communities to (a) _query_ and _navigate_ the actual wikidata in a graphical way and (b) based on that, _create_ and _share_ personal views (so called Topic Maps) around items currently discussed in wikidata.

Currently wikidata can be queried  in the following (randomly selected) languages:

`Afrikaans`, `Albanian`, `Arabic`, `Burmes`, `Chinese`, `English`, `German`, `Greek`, `Indonesian`, `Japanese`, `Kirundi`, `Persian`, `Polish`, `Portuguese`, `Romanian`, `Russian`, `Sanskrit`, `Slovak`, `Slovene`, `Spanish`, `Swedish`, `Thai` and `Turkish`.

If your language is missing here, please excuse that and file an issue at http://trac.deepamehta.de.

https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

## Download & Installation

You can find a bundle file for installation at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).

Copy the downloaded `dm43-wikidata-search-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar` file into your DeepaMehta bundle repository and re-start your [DeepaMehta installation](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#requirements).

## Usage

Instead of "By Text" choose the "Wikidata Search"-Search Mode in the DeepaMehta Toolbar. Select the language you want to search and enter the term you are interested in.

For any search-result entity of type "item" you can `Import claims` and after that, navigate to ''related'' wikidata-items.

For any search-result entity of type "property" ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [they are](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) there is a "+" (`Turn into Associaton Type`-command) availble in the result listing.
