# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Plugin

This plugin enables you to search, explore and map the "shared structures of meaning" (Janet Murray, New Media Reader, 2003) of [wikidata-communities](http://www.wikidata.org/wiki) from all around the globe.

Its functionality also enables you to build on these structures in your personal information work through enabling you to turn any search-result entity ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [they are](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) into a DeepaMehta *Assocation Type*.

[DeepaMehta](http://www.deepamehta.de) is a free software platform for associative and personal information work and a situation-centered user interface based on *free placement* in *stable views*.


## Download

You can find the installable bundle-file at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).


## Installation

Copy the downloaded `wikidata-type-search-0.0.1.jar` file into your DeepaMehta bundle repository and re-start your [DeepaMehta installation](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#requirements).


## Usage & Installation Hints

Instead of "By Text" choose the "Wikidata Relation"-Search Mode in the DeepaMehta Toolbar. Select the language you want to search and enter the term you are interested in.

Any search-result entity ([wikidata properties](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Data_model#Properties) - [they are](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:List_of_properties)) can be turned into an ''Association Type'' if you click the "+" (visible in the result listing).
